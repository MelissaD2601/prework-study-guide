# Coding Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

This prework study guide was designed to help coding boot camp students learn about HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and JavaScript. The study guide provides bullet point information about each topic, with each topic having its own dedicated section on the webpage. Students created the prework study guide by following step-by-step instructions provided in The Coding Boot Camp's Prework. By creating the prework study guide, students were introduced to HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and JavaScript in a manner in which allowed students to apply the working knowledge toward creating possibly the first, of many, of their webpages.
